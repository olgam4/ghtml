# Codebase Context

Read `.claude/CODEBASE.md` for architecture overview, module guide, and key patterns before implementing any task. Update `.claude/CODEBASE.md` after completing implementations that add new modules, change architecture, or introduce new patterns.

# Development Workflow

## Test Driven Development
1. Implement tests for the change that fail
2. Implement the simplest implementation that succeeds
3. Refactor to the least complex state:
   - Most maintainable and extendible
   - Uses idiomatic Gleam/Lustre patterns
   - Handles edge cases
   - Includes documentation comments

## Commands
See the Quick Reference table in `.claude/CODEBASE.md` for all commands. Key ones:
- `just check` - Run all quality checks before committing
- `just ci` - Simulate CI pipeline before pushing

## GIF Recording

Regenerate README demos with `just gifs`. See `assets/gif-record/README.md` for prerequisites and details.

# Task Management

All tasks are tracked in **Beads**, a git-backed issue tracker.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# View available work
bd ready              # Tasks ready to work on (no blockers)
bd list               # All tasks
bd show <id>          # Task details

# Work on tasks
just orchestrate      # Run parallel agents
just worker <id>      # Work on single task
just orchestrate-status  # Check progress

# Create work
bd create "Task name" -p 1    # Create task (priority 0-4)
bd dep add <task> <blocker>   # Add dependency
bd close <id>                 # Complete task
```

## Creating Work

```bash
# Create epic (note the ID, e.g., ghtml-a1b2)
bd create "Epic: Feature Name" -p 0 --label epic

# Create tasks under epic (use --parent to link)
bd create "Implement parser" -p 1 --label task --parent ghtml-a1b2

# Add detailed description via comment
bd comment <task-id> "
## Requirements
- Parse X format
- Handle edge cases Y, Z

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
"

# Set dependencies between tasks
bd dep add <task-id> <blocker-id>
```

## Detailed Specifications

For complex features requiring detailed specs, use `.claude/specs/`:
- Specs contain requirements.md, design.md, research/
- See `.claude/specs/CONVENTIONS.md` for EARS notation

# Execution Modes

## Automated Mode (Parallel Agents)

For parallel agent execution with PR workflow:
- Status tracked in Beads
- Multiple agents work concurrently
- Automatic PR creation and merging
- See: `.claude/docs/orchestration.md`

```bash
bd init                           # Initialize (first time)
just orchestrate --epic <id>      # Run parallel agents
just merger                       # Process PRs
```

## Manual Mode (Single Task)

For human-orchestrated, step-by-step execution:

```bash
bd ready                          # Find available task
bd show <id>                      # View task details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim it
# ... implement ...
just check                        # Verify quality
bd close <id>                     # Mark complete
```

## When to Use Which

| Scenario | Mode |
|----------|------|
| Learning/exploring the codebase | Manual |
| Single focused task | Manual |
| Multiple independent tasks | Automated |
| Want PR review workflow | Automated |
| CI/CD integration | Automated |

# Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

## Checklist

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create Beads issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - `just check`
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed

## Critical Rules

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
