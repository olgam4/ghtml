# Tasks

## Overview

This directory contains individual task specifications for the E2E Testing epic. Each task is designed to be independently executable once its dependencies are satisfied.

## Task Naming Convention

Tasks are named with a three-digit prefix followed by a descriptive name:
- `000_test_restructure.md`
- `001_e2e_infrastructure.md`
- `002_project_template_fixture.md`

The numbering indicates a recommended execution order, though tasks can be executed in parallel if their dependencies are satisfied.

## Task Status

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 000 | Test Restructure | [x] Complete | Prerequisite for all other tasks |
| 001 | E2E Test Infrastructure | [x] Complete | Depends on 000 |
| 002 | Project Template Fixture | [x] Complete | Depends on 001 |
| 003 | Fixture Enhancement | [x] Complete | Depends on 000; enhances existing fixtures |
| 004 | Build Verification Tests | [x] Complete | Depends on 001, 002, 003 |
| 005 | Add Lustre Dev Dependency | [x] Complete | Independent |
| 006 | SSR Test Modules | [x] Complete | Depends on 003, 005 |
| 007 | SSR HTML Tests | [x] Complete | Depends on 005, 006 |
| 008 | Justfile Integration | [x] Complete | Depends on 000, 004, 007 |
| 009 | Slim Integration Tests | [ ] Pending | Depends on 007; removes redundant tests |

Status legend:
- `[ ] Pending` - Not started
- `[~] In Progress` - Currently being worked on
- `[x] Complete` - Finished and verified
- `[!] Blocked` - Waiting on external dependency

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Check dependencies first** - Ensure all prerequisite tasks are complete
2. **Follow TDD** - Write tests before implementation (see CLAUDE.md)
3. **Verify success criteria** - All criteria must be met before marking complete
4. **Run full checks** - Use `just check` before marking complete
5. **Commit atomically** - Each task should result in a single commit

## Parallel Execution

The following tasks can be worked on in parallel:
- Task 000 must complete first (prerequisite)
- After 000: Tasks 001, 003, and 005 can run in parallel
- Tasks 006 and 004 can run in parallel once their deps are met

## Adding New Tasks

1. Copy an existing task file as a template
2. Fill in all sections
3. Update this README with the new task
4. Update the parent PLAN.md task table and dependency graph
