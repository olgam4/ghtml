# Research

This directory contains research documents created during epic planning.

## Purpose

Research files capture:
- Investigation of tools, libraries, or approaches
- Comparison of alternatives
- Technical deep-dives
- Findings that inform the PLAN.md

## Workflow

1. **Explore** - Investigate options, read docs, test approaches
2. **Document** - Write findings in markdown files here
3. **Synthesize** - Use research to create/update PLAN.md
4. **Reference** - Link research files from PLAN.md for context

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the research topic:
- `tool_comparison.md` - Comparing multiple tools
- `api_investigation.md` - Deep-dive into an API
- `performance_analysis.md` - Benchmarks or performance research
